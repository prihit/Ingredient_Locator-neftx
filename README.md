# Ingredient_Locator-neftx

### Say that you have 5 stores and 5 recipes. Assume that all stores are at the same distance from you(travel cost and time are the same to go to multiple stores too). Each recipe has different ingredients. Each store has coupons for different ingredients with their own discount amount. Write code that will display the set of stores that would cost minimum for a recipe.
